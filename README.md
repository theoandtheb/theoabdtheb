### If you didn't notice by now, I go by Owen

A secturities trader (specialiing in options) in a past life, I could best be described as a reluctantly transient developer hoping to find the right place to put down stakes.  Best described as an observant, creative problem solver and diplomat, I fit an odd niche as a professional:  One who can pick up on a business case quickly, assess a situation and power through a lot of hard lessons, which been perceived as a great fit for an estbalished team.  I've endured nearly every bad practice imaginable, battled toxic cultures (and have the scars to prove it) and endured more than a decade of accumulated tech debt. When I am not working, I am often wrapped up in politics, busy assisting my extended family or enslaved by my cat.  An athlete in my youth, I am largely relegsted to spectating due to a series of lasting injuries.
